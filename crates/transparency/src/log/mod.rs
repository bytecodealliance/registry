//! Immutable Log w/ Inclusion and Consistency Proofs
//!
//! The main trait in this module is [`VerifiableLog`],
//! which defines the API of a log where inclusion
//! and consistency can be verified.
//!
//! Implementations:
//! * [`InOrderLog`] -
//!
//! The only implementation in this module is ,
//! which is a [`VerifiableLog`] whose contents are structured
//! using binary in-order interval numbering as described in
//! [Dat - Distributed Dataset Synchronization and Versioning][2].

/// A [merkle tree][0] log data type based on [DAT][1].
/// where the merkle tree computation is conformant to
/// [RFC 6962 - Certificate Transparency][2]. This allows
/// you to efficiently append data and then verify that
/// it the log is consistent over time and contains a
/// given entry.
///
/// It represents its data using binary in-order interval numbering.
/// This means that all of the leaf and balanced branch nodes of the tree
/// are stored in one contiguous array using a particular indexing scheme.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```text
/// 0 X \
/// 1    X
/// 2 X / \
/// 3      X
/// 4 X \ /
/// 5    X
/// 6 X /
/// ```
///
/// ## Properties
/// This has various convenient properties for traversing the structure.
/// * The height of a node is the number of trailing ones in its index.
/// * For the above reason, leaves always have even indices.
/// * The side (left/right) of a node can be computed from its index.
/// * The distance between parent/child indices is a simple function of height.
